# Rock-Paper-Scissor-GUI
To whom it may concern,
Please make sure to download ALL FILES when trying to download the GUI. If you do NOT download the images included in the repository, your IDE will give you error messages stating it cannot find the files of the images. Without these images, you are unable to play the game.

I would like it to be made clear that I worked with TWO other students in my programming class to develop this GUI. I am not claiming total credit for the project as it was a shared effort and all parties involved in the production of the GUI have been credited. 
Enjoy the GUI! : )
